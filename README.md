# Quarkus OpenSearch Client

An extension to Quarkus providing an OpenSearch Java client, as well as Dev Services container during testing.

Using:

Quarkus: `2.14.0-Final`
OpenSearch Java Client: `2.1.0`
OpenSearch Server: `2.3.0`  (via Docker in Dev Services)
Kotlin: `1.7.21`

This is by far not fully configurable and is just a base implementation based off of the code from Quarkus Elasticsearch extension.

Releases are available from JitPack: https://jitpack.io/#sort-dev/quarkus-opensearch-client
