# Quarkus OpenSearch Client

An extension to Quarkus providing an OpenSearch Java client, as well as Dev Services container during testing.

Using:

Quarkus: `2.14.0-Final`
OpenSearch Java Client: `1.0.0`
OpenSearch Server: `1.3.6`  (via Docker in Dev Services)
Kotkin: `1.7.20`

This is by far not fully configurable and is just a base implementation based off of the code from Quarkus Elasticsearch extension.
